# BluetoothControlledSmartCar
>## Overview.
>>This project represents Bluetooth controlled robotic car. The project aims in designing a Robot that can be operated using Android mobile phone. The controlling of the Robot is done wirelessly through Android smart phone using the Bluetooth feature present in it. We present a review of robots controlled by mobile phone via moving the robot upward, backward, left and right side by android application. Here in the project the Android smart phone is used as a remote control for operating the Robot. The controlling device of the whole system is a Microcontroller. Bluetooth module, DC motors are interfaced to the Microcontroller.<br/>
> ## Concept Behind the Project.
>>When using the MOSFET as a switch we can drive the MOSFET to turn “ON” faster or slower, or pass high or low currents. This ability to turn the power MOSFET “ON” and “OFF” allows the device to be used as a very efficient switch with switching speeds much faster than standard bipolar junction transistors. In this project MOSFET is used as switch to control the motors.
